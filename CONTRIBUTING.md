## Questions?
Instead of opening issues for your questions, It's ideal to ask questions on StackOverflow since they have more users and are more likely to get the answer. You could also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3Pg2Nw2vjn) and ask your questions there.

## Bug Reports
If you find a bug, please open an Issue or better, create a Pull Request.

## Feature Requests
If you want to suggest a new feature, please open an Issue with the relevant details.

If you want to implement a major feature, please create an issue so we can discuss it first.

## Commit Messages
Please follow [Semantic Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) Format for your commits.
