# Introduction

Aureolin is a framework for building web applications. It is based on the [Koa](https://koajs.com/) framework. Aureolin leverages the [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) paradigm to create a modular and reusable application.

# Features
- Decorator based routing
- Highly configurable & scalable
- Server Side Rendering (JSX)
- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- Strongly Typed

Aureolin is hevily inspired by [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

## Configuration

In Aureolin, configuration is everything. To configure Aureolin, you need to create an `aureolin.config.js` file in the root of your project. An example of this file is available [here](https://github.com/alensaito1/aureolin/blob/master/examples/basic/aureolin.config.js).
